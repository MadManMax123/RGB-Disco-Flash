Define RGB LED Pins:
- At lines 1-3, assign constants (r_pin, g_pin, and b_pin) to represent pin numbers for the RGB LED components. This improves code readability and allows easy modification of pin assignments.

Declare Variables for RGB Values:
- At lines 5-7, declare variables (r, g, and b) to store the randomly generated values for the RGB LED components.

Initialization in Setup Function:
- In the setup function at lines 9-15:
	* Set pin modes for RGB LED components as outputs using pinMode.
	* Initiate serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 for debugging purposes using Serial.begin.
	* Seed the random number generator with an analog reading at line 14.

RGB Flash Function:
- In the rgbFlash function at lines 17-27:
	* Set PWM values for each RGB LED component using analogWrite to control brightness.
	* Print RGB values to the Serial Monitor using Serial.print statements.

Main Loop:
- In the loop function at lines 29-34:
	* Generate random values for r, g, and b within the range of 0 to 224 using the random function.
	* Call the rgbFlash function at line 32 to flash the RGB LED with the generated random values.
	* Introduce a delay of 500 milliseconds at line 33 to control the flashing speed.


This program continuously generates random RGB values and flashes an RGB LED accordingly, utilizing the Serial Monitor for debugging by displaying the generated RGB values. The structure of the code facilitates modularity and readability.
